# Adding Lottie Animations to CRM Login Page

In this enhancement, I've added Lottie animations to the login page to complement the existing 3D avatar. These animations provide a modern and engaging user experience.

## Features Added:

1. **Integrated Lottie Animations**: Created and integrated two Lottie animations:
   - A friendly CRM avatar animation
   - A business analysis animation showing charts and graphs

2. **Animation Switcher**: Added controls to switch between:
   - 3D WebGL avatar and Lottie animations
   - Different Lottie animations (CRM avatar or business analysis)

3. **Responsive Design**: Ensured animations display properly on all device sizes

## How It Works:

The login page now uses the existing `LottieAnimation` component to load and display JSON animation files. When WebGL is not available or when users prefer a lighter animation option, they can switch to the Lottie animations.

## Technical Implementation:

- Used the existing `LottieAnimation` component which handles animation loading and playback
- Added state management for toggling between animation types
- Created custom JSON animation files in the `/public/animations/` directory
- Integrated responsive UI controls for switching animation types

## Benefits:

- Improved visual appeal with smooth, modern animations
- Reduced resource usage when switching from 3D to Lottie
- More engaging user experience on the login page
- Animation variety to keep the interface fresh and interesting

The Lottie animations offer a modern look while being lightweight and performant compared to 3D WebGL rendering.
